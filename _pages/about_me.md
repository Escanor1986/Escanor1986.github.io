Hello! I’m **Lionel Zovi**, a Full-Stack Developer with over two decades of experience turning complex problems into elegant, reliable software. I started coding back in 2002 with C++, Visual Basic and HTML, and today I specialize in modern JavaScript/TypeScript stacks (React, Next.js, Node.js) as well as Java/Spring Boot.

Before moving full-time into tech, I served as a field and administrative police officer—an experience that taught me the value of clear communication, rigorous analysis, and keeping a cool head under pressure. Those skills still guide my work: I aim to write code that’s secure, performant, and maintainable.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new open-source tools, reading up on cloud-native architectures, or contributing to community projects on GitHub. I also enjoy learning new languages (I speak French natively along with professional English and intermediate Dutch and Italian).

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Escanor1986), check out my latest blog posts, or join me in the r/programming subreddit for lively discussions and resources.
