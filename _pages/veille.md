# My Technology Watch

I maintain a technology watch on the latest trends and innovations in web development, JavaScript, and modern frameworks.

## About this project

This technology watch has been **entirely designed and developed by me** using:

- **Github Actions** for continuous deployment
- **Jekyll** for static site generation
- **JavaScript** for interactions and dynamic functionalities
- **SCSS/CSS** for design and custom animations
- **HTML5** for structure and accessibility

I chose these technologies for their performance, flexibility, and to put into practice the skills on which I maintain my technology watch.
