# Knowledge Sharing

Although I don't yet have formal teaching experience, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and supporting people who want to get started in web development.

## My Teaching Philosophy

For me, learning development should be:

- **Practical above all**: learning by creating concrete projects
- **Progressive**: starting with the basics before tackling advanced concepts
- **Collaborative**: sharing knowledge and learning from others

## Resources I Recommend

Here's a selection of resources that have helped me along my journey:

### For Beginners

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - Reference documentation
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - Free learning path
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - Interactive courses

### For Further Learning

- [NX Academy](https://nx.academy/) - Free and open source learning platform
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) - In-depth guide to JavaScript
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - CSS tips and guides
- [Dyma](https://dyma.fr/developer/accueil) - Online training site (Tutorials + written courses)

## Contributing to Open Source Education

I'm actively contributing to [NX Academy](https://nx.academy/), an exceptional open-source learning platform created by a colleague. NX Academy is dedicated to providing high-quality, accessible web development education to everyone.

### My Contributions

As a technical writer for NX Academy, I create in-depth articles and tutorials on:

- Modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries
- Web development best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- DevOps and deployment strategies

These contributions align with my belief that knowledge should be freely accessible, structured, and practical. Writing technical content for NX Academy allows me to give back to the developer community while continuously refining my own understanding of complex concepts.

## Availability for Mentoring

I'm open to formal & informal mentoring opportunities and knowledge sharing. If you're new to web development and looking for advice, don't hesitate to contact me.

In the long term, I would like to develop more teaching materials and offer introductory workshops on web development.
