# Knowledge Sharing

Although I don't yet have formal teaching experience, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and supporting people who want to get started in web development.

## My Teaching Philosophy

For me, learning development should be:

- **Practical above all**: learning by creating concrete projects
- **Progressive**: starting with the basics before tackling advanced concepts
- **Collaborative**: sharing knowledge and learning from others

## Resources I Recommend

Here's a selection of resources that have helped me along my journey:

### For Beginners

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - Reference documentation
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - Free learning path
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - Interactive courses

### For Further Learning

- [NX Academy](https://nx.academy/) - Free and open source learning platform (Excellent! XD)

## Educational Projects

I'm currently developing some projects that can serve as educational examples:

- A mini CSS framework to understand design principles
- Commented examples of React applications for beginners
- A series of progressive JavaScript challenges

## Availability for Mentoring

I'm open to formal & informal mentoring opportunities and knowledge sharing. If you're new to web development and looking for advice, don't hesitate to contact me.

In the long term, I would like to develop teaching materials and offer introductory workshops on web development.
