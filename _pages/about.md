## Biography

I’m **Lionel Zovi**, a full-stack developer passionate about web and cloud technologies since 2002. After more than fifteen years as a police officer, I refocused my career on software development. Trained initially in C++, Visual Basic, and HTML, I’ve since mastered modern JavaScript/TypeScript stacks (React, Node.js, Next.js) and Java/Spring Boot, as well as DevOps best practices (Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions).

In every project, I bring analytical rigor, stress management, and meticulous attention to detail—skills honed during my policing career. A firm believer in continuous learning, I actively contribute to open-source projects and share my expertise through trainings and technical articles.
